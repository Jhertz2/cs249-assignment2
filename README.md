# CS249-Assignment 2
Code and other scripts needed for assignment-2 (CS249-Fall 2020 Assignment 2)

Currently the scripts are windows 10 friendly. We will convert this to python scripts so you can run it on other OS (OSX and Ubunutu).

The instruction for how to use this repository (assignment 2) is available [here](https://github.com/tinyMLx/Harvard_CS249_F20/tree/master/assignments/person_detection)
