# CS249-Assignment 2
Code and other scripts needed for assignment-2 (CS249-Fall 2020 Assignment 2)

Currently, the scripts are windows 10 friendly. We will convert this to python scripts so you can run it on other OS (OSX and Ubuntu).

The instruction for how to use this repository (assignment 2) is available [here](https://github.com/tinyMLx/Harvard_CS249_F20/tree/master/assignments/person_detection)

# Acknowledgements
This repository is the trimmed version of the original TensorFlow [model repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git). We refactored the repository to include files/scripts needed to complete this module. But please do check the original repository for other awesome projects and necessary files.
